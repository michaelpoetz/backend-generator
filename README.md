backend-generator
=================

Create a model for your system's backend in a simple DSL. This program then generates Java classes from Entity to Webservice including test classes for Bean and Webservice.

* This project is still in early development phase.


Prerequisites
=============
* This project relies on xtext, an Eclipse plugin for DSLs.
* A maven POM will be included soon, I hope 


Roadmap
=======
* Writing a grammar
* Writing a code generator based upon that grammar
* Wrinting models - testing
